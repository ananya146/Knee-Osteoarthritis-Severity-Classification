Osteoarthritis (OA) is a degenerative joint disorder characterized by cartilage breakdown, affecting
various joints. Knee osteoarthritis (KOA) specifically targets the knee joint, causing pain, stiffness, and
reduced mobility, impacting the quality of life. The emergence of AI and deep learning has revolutionized
KOA detection, offering enhanced precision and efficiency. This study integrates a novel Convolutional
Block Attention Module (CBAM) with EfficientNet B0, designed to selectively refine feature
representations. This CBAM mechanism contributes to effective feature extraction, demonstrating
promise for robust and precise image classification tasks across diverse scenarios. Through meticulous
training on the OAI dataset, our proposed method achieves a noteworthy accuracy of 67%, showcasing
its potential in effective knee osteoarthritis classification.
